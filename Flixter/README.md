### Notes

- Laptop did not have VT-x enabled in the BIOS and I was unable to get the AVD working. After enabling VT-x in the BIOS and adding YoutubePlayer to the DetailActivity the app kept crashing on both a virtual device and a physical device). I had to delete everything, including AVDs and restart from where flix Part 1 left off. Installing a new AVD, updating a SDK tool and restarting android studio worked and development was smooth henceforth.
- Data Bindig is a bit confusing, there were so many different ways to bind the views. I'm not sure I did that correctly but will update as I continue to learn and grasp the concept better
- I forgot that images needed to be loaded through glide/picasso and when I implemented the play icon and spent hours wondering why I could not see it, lol. 
- Took me forever to implement playback for Youtube so that it continued to play from it's current timestamp whenever the screen orientation changed, instead of starting at the beginning
- Tried implementing a shadow effect, failed miserably lol
- Also failed to implement a loading icon. I did but removed it because it was not to my liking.
- I've learned that I do not have an eye for design üòÇ. I tried but the app still isn't appealing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [X] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [X] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [X] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [X] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [X] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [X] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [X] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Challenges encountered while building the app:

When trying to connect to the Movie DB API I received a network request error 500 message. I was able to fix the problem by creating a new emulator with API level 28 instead of API level 29. I also made sure to update the gradle.build (Moduele: app) file with the correct API levels as well.
